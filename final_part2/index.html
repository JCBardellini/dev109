    <ul>
        <li>Built my portfolio from scratch</li>
        <li>Wanted to expand my knowledge in CSS and get better at manipulating divs and other ways to style components</li>
        <li>Building the portfolio from scratch gave me freedom to explore new design styles, but also taking CSS libraries into consideration</li>

    <h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (i.e., the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I think the most challenging part of my portfolio was hosting it, because I would have to manipulate github to make sure that everything displayed</li>
        <li>Another aspect that was hard or challenging was CSS and JS, CSS was hard because there is so many ways to style the same component</li>
        <li>JS was challenging too because if we messed up on the syntax the JS file will create an error so I was always double checking my work</li>
    </ul>
